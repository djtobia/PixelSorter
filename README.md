# PixelSorter

Add the image file you wish to sort as a commandline argument, and the program does the rest. The program, at this stage, outputs a gradient image, and the row-sorted image. 

The file names will be "originalImageNameGradientSorted.jpg" and "originalImageNameSorted.jpg" and will be located in the same directory as the original file.
