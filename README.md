# PixelSorter2
Just like the original PixelSorter, but it is now broken into a separate class, and the driver also makes a gradient of the original image.


Add the image file you wish to sort as a commandline argument, and the program does the rest. The program, at this stage, outputs a gradient image, and the row-sorted image. 

The file names will be "originalImageNameGradientSorted.jpg" and "originalImageNameSorted.jpg"
